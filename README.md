   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   REACT_APP_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL=your_cloud_function_url
   ```   

4. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project and configure Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, and Storage).
   - Set up Firebase Cloud Functions:
     ```bash
     cd functions
     npm install
     firebase deploy --only functions
     cd ..
     ```
    - Or you can also run firebase cloud function locally
    ```bash
     cd functions
     npm install
     firebase emulator:start
     ```
     By default port
     ```URL
     http://127.0.0.1:5001/[Something starts like this]
     ```

5. **Set up Stripe**:
   - Get your Stripe API keys from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
   - Add your Stripe keys to your Firebase Cloud Functions environment.

6. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Deployment

To deploy the project, you can use Firebase Hosting:

1. **Build the project**:
